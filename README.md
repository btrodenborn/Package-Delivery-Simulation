# Package-Delivery-Simulation
A project created using Python to simulate an optimized package delivery route.

## Project Features:
* Use CSV data for delivery address and distances
* Takes package constraints into account when creating delivery routes
* Generates optimized delivery routes for efficient package delivery
* Use of a self-adjusting data structure to store project data.
* Delivery routes created by using the nearest neighbor algorithm.
